# Plugins

This page lists all plugins supported by`go-to-exec`.

## AWS SNS

You can create AWS SNS subscriptions, and point them to a `go-to-exec` instance, to automatically confirm the
subscription and process SNS messages. The AWS SNS plugin automatically verifies the validity of the messages.

The AWS SNS plugin will add a `/sns` route to your listener, and you can refer to this route when you will add an SNS
subscription.

```
# Before
https://mydomain.com/test

# With SNS plugin
https://mydomain.com/test <- can be used for simulations
https://mydomain.com/test/sns <- automatically decode/support SNS messages
```

Whenever AWS SNS sends a message to the `/sns` endpoint, `go-to-exec` will inject in your payload the SNS notification
arguments.

E.g. you can access the `Message` field via:

```go-template
My message is: {{ .Message }}
```

All the available SNS notification arguments are defined in the following struct:

[filename](../pkg/snshttp/notification.go ':include :type=code :fragment=sns-notification')

### Configuration

[filename](../pkg/plugin_aws_sns.go ':include :type=code :fragment=config')

### Example

This is an example on how to use the AWS SNS plugin:

[filename](../examples/config.plugin.awssns.yaml ':include :type=code')

## HTTP response

You can alter the HTTP response for every listener by using the `httpResponse` plugin.

The customizable elements are:

* HTTP headers
* Status code (defaults to `200`)

You can use templates to customize the fields, and the context of the argument will match the context of the templates
used in the normal listeners, plus an additional `__gteResult` map, which contains the command execution result.

The `__gteResult` map consists of the following fields:

[filename](../pkg/listener.go ':include :type=code :fragment=exec-command-result')

[filename](../pkg/routes.go ':include :type=code :fragment=listener-response')

E.g. you can use `.__gteResult.Output`, `__gteResult.Storage`, etc..

NOTE: the plugin will be executed **only** when the command has been executed successfully. If the command returns an
error, there will be a standard response.

### Configuration

[filename](../pkg/plugin_http_response.go ':include :type=code :fragment=config')

### Examples

This is an example on how to use the HTTP response plugin:

[filename](../examples/config.plugin.httpresponse.yaml ':include :type=code')

And, another example, which makes use of temporary files to store a redirection target:

[filename](../examples/config.plugin.httpresponse-file.yaml ':include :type=code')

## Preview

There are cases where you may want to preview the command you want to execute, think for example about any critical
commands you may want to run once or check in advance.

For this purpose you can use the `preview` plugin, which will add a `/preview` route to your listener(s). Using this
route, you will be able to see what the command execution will be like.

You can also customize the `/preview` route to have its own authentication method, especially if you don't want to keep
private the content of a command. This authentication configuration follows the same rules as a
generic [listener one](./home.md#authentication).

An example of what you can see with this plugin is:

```yaml
command: echo
args:
  - Hello Mr. Anderson
```

### Configuration

[filename](../pkg/plugin_preview.go ':include :type=code :fragment=config')

### Examples

This is an example on how to use the preview plugin:

[filename](../examples/config.plugin.preview.yaml ':include :type=code')
