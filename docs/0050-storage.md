# Storage

Every listener can be configured to store to different services (S3, GCP, azblob, etcâ€¦):

* The payloads they receive, which means the dump of the HTTP request (`args` key).
* The executed command, its arguments and environment variables (`command` key).
* The command output (`output` key).

qValet uses the amazing [`go-storage`](https://github.com/beyondstorage/go-storage) library,
which [supports](https://beyondstorage.io/docs/go-storage/services/index) a broad variety of storage
destinations. qValet tries to support all the storage options in the "Stable" category. If you notice there is a
missing library, please open an [issue](https://github.com/cmaster11/qvalet/issues)!

Here is an example, which uses GCS and FS (file-system) as a storage backend:
